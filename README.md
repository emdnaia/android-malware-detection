# android-malware-detection
This is a opensource repo about how to detect android malware using Random Forest Classifier and explain it use linearsvc.
Why we use the simple Random Forest Model to see https://liansecurity.feishu.cn/docx/FY6PdTTE7oJF5rxZRPNcm9sZnOe?from=from_copylink.


## How to run
Train:
```
python permission_select.py train 
```
Predict:
```
python3 permission_select.py predict android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE android.permission.VIBRATE android.permission.INTERNET ...
```

## Future work
This model only achieves 85% accuracy rate even on our own test data. We are trying to add the data of behavior analysis to training. If we achieve better accuracy, we will continue to open source.
